#  

# This week's homework assignment I had to modified a stater code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they've selected.  The users will be prompted to choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters and choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special charcaters. When the users ansewered all prompts then the the password is generated that matches the selected criteria.
